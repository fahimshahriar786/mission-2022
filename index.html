                    not
                    allowing us to use
                    some extra time to pay down some of the technical debt we’ve introduced in the past few months. We
                    might
                    also feel like we could use better technologies to improve our lives but either higher forces
                    disagree
                    with us or the code base is just too much of a mess to upgrade.
                    This is mostly what most of our limitations come down to, lack of time. Deadlines exist for very
                    good
                    reasons, they might sometimes be exploited by a bad management team.</p>

            <h3>Assalamu walaikum!</h3>
            <p class="forth-p-tag">Originally from Comilla, Fahim has been on rivers his whole life, runs the river
                year round and his
                favorite run in our winter is the amazing Futaleufu during the Austral summer.

                He is a man who lives life according to his “river time” ethos, which means he never stops, just as
                a
                river never stops flowing… He mends, fixes and restores whatever he can. Out on the river, he is
                talented, at one with the river and makes you see his lines, sometimes they are the harder ones. But
                he
                will get you the most your bang for your buck, guaranteed! At the camp-fire he will entertain you
                with
                tales, adventures past and songs while strumming his guitar or banjo! He is also the only person we
                know
                who has taken a paddle board from ‘Bridge to Bridge’ section on the Fu!!!</p>
